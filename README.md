# Jumpa

Real time generative art and processing + hype gradle project template...ish
## How to run

```bash
./gradlew run
```

## How to build

```bash
./gradlew build
```

## Features
- Real time processing
- Minim audio library
- Video playing

## Visualizations

Visuals are intended to be used with DOOMxGUTS music
and custom Doom Eternal gameplay footage.

## ⚠️ MAC USERS ⚠️ (THIS IS SOMEWHAT OUTDATED)
- Testes on apple silicon M3 chip,
building the fat jar and running the app works fine
(probably rosetta is involved), 
but running the app using the gradle task `run` will probably not work.
